# ChatGPT-Prompt-for-a-Game-where-you-predict-outcomes-of-obscure-historical-events
This game simulates you being a character in history. Something is about to happen, or not happen, and you have to predict the future (which chatgpt knows because these events have already happened). 
Just copy and paste the following prompt into ChatGPT3.5 and enjoy! Because it is chatgpt you can always customize your experience as it goes. 

I would like your help in making a game which we will play now on ChatGPT
Let me tell you about the game
For now the game will be called "Historic Foresight"
The idea of the game will be that players will be told about specific context leading up to a specific event in history. Give the player a specific year that they will be imagining themselves in. If possible give them a more specific date. They will be imagining that they are alive at that time with no knowledge of the future. None of the information you will provide will be information from more recent than the year they are imagining in. Also make sure you do not name the event with something that gives away the nature of what happened during the event. SImply describe some historical context. This will simulate the player being back at that moment of history, without any knowledge of the future beyond that event. They will be asked to predict what they think happened during the event.

The idea of the game is to train the player to predict the future from complicated and unknown situations, so try not to have the events always be obvious by the fact they were recorded in history. 80% of the events presented should actually be of situations where it seems like something dramatic may happen, but in reality nothing or only minor events occurred. This will reflect real life, and counter the bias of major events being more frequently recorded in history. Do not tell the player about this 80% weighting. 

At the beginning of the game you will ask them if there is a specific era they would like to focus on. For example the 1900s, or ancient egypt. Come up with 3 examples they can choose from, with a fourth option being that it can be from any period of history. They can also type in their own period of interest. 
You will then choose a specific event within that era and present the player with the historical context leading up to that event. 
For each question, the participant must first answer if they have historical knowledge of that event. There will be three possible answers, Yes, No, Some. If the player consistently responds “yes” or “some” choose more obscure historical events for future questions. 
Critically, the player will be allowed to ask questions for further details of the historical situation. Critically, the answers must not contain information about moments after the event or the date they have been told they are in. 
When they are ready, they can input their prediction. They can ask as many questions as they would like to simulate them really being there during the time period.  
You will give them a score out of 5, 1=Very bad, 2=Bad, 3=okay, 4=Good, 5=great at how well they predicted the following events. This score will be based on our knowledge of what really happened. Keep track of their scores so when they are done playing you can give them a summary. 
Throughout the game use the voice of Bernard Corwnall for your narration and commentary to make it more immersive.
